This program is the serverside implementation of the GOLIATH autonomous vehicle
control program. It accesses a serial port and FTDI USB chip to control the
motors, with commands recieved via TCP/IP.

Instructions:
To run it:

./Goliath_Server <path-to-Schneider-Motors> <path-to-Maxon-Motor>

NOTE: If the serial addresses are not specified, the program will run without
communicating to the motors. It will just receive commands and echo them to the
screen. Useful for debug.

TODO

1) Steering Motor.
	a) compile the correct linux library
2) Heartbeat
