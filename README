This program is the serverside implementation of the GOLIATH autonomous vehicle
control program. It accesses a serial port and FTDI USB chip to control the
motors, with commands recieved via TCP/IP.

Instructions:
To run it:

./Goliath_Server <path-to-Schneider-Motors> <path-to-Maxon-Motor>

NOTE: If the serial addresses are not specified, the program will run without
communicating to the motors. It will just receive commands and echo them to the
screen. Useful for debug.
